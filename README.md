# AntennaPod with no SSL validation

This is a fork of the [AntennaPod](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod) podcast player which removes validation of SSL certificates. It might be helpful for users of older Android devices or users that want to connect to servers with self-signed SSL certificates.


This fork uses a different app ID than the official version of AntennaPod so both versions can be installed at once. If you are using the official version and want to switch over, export the database from the official version and then import it into this version.


Please check the [releases](https://github.com/MrRar/AntennaPod/releases/) page to download this version of AntennaPod.
